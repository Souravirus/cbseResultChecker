## cbseResultChecker

This is a notifier to notify you when you want yourself notified when the result is declared. This notifies you by playing a song in your computer. Run the program when cbse results weren't declared.

1. First of all there should be php in your computer. To install php in your computer you can see many guides on google.

2. Now there should also be php-curl in your computer.I installed it in my computer by 
```
sudo apt-get install php7.0-curl
```
3. Now install play in ubuntu or replace play with any other music app. To install libsox-fmt-mp3 steps are:
```
 sudo apt-get install sox libsox-fmt-mp3
```
4. Also replace the music with other music location in your computer.

5. Now go to terminal and type 
```
php cbseresultscrapper.php
```
PS. This program is not in its best version for now. I have make too much improvements in this code. If anyone one to contribute then your help would be much appreciated.
